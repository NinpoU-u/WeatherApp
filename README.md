# WeatherApp
Weather application with MVP architecture.

A ready-made application on the full MVP architecture, which shows the weather forecast for today and the next 5 days with an interval of 3 hours. The place is tied to the geolocation of the phone. The application does NOT use any frameworks, only standard Android SDK methods are used
